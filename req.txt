Webhooks


Webhooks are a way for web applications to communicate with each other in real-time. Essentially, a webhook is a mechanism that allows one application to send automatic notifications or messages to another application when a certain event occurs.

Here's how they typically work:

Event Occurs: In the context of webhooks, an event could be anything from a new user signing up on a website to a payment being processed.
HTTP POST Request: When the event occurs, the application that wants to be notified sends an HTTP POST request containing information about the event to a predefined URL of the receiving application.
Receiving Application's Endpoint: The receiving application has an endpoint set up to listen for incoming webhook requests. When it receives a request, it can then take actions based on the data sent in the request.
Processing the Event: Once the receiving application receives the webhook request, it can process the information and take appropriate actions, such as updating a database, triggering another process, sending a notification, etc.
Webhooks are commonly used for various purposes such as integrating different services, automating workflows, and enabling real-time updates between applications. 
They are widely used in the context of APIs and web services to enable seamless communication between different systems.
